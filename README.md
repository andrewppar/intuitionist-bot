# Welcome To The Documentation For Intuitionistic Bot! 

## Intro

Intuitionistc Bot is a twitter bot that reminds the world not to forget that there was a crisis in the foundations of mathematics that has never been adequately resolved. While classical logicians and mathematics are widely regarded as having won the debate about what theorems were true, constructive mathematicians maintain that certain of these so-called theorems are only true based on metaphysical assumptions of the mainstream mathematicians. Constructive mathematics is based on intuitionstic logic developed by Heytinhg with roots in Browerian mathematics. Intuitionstic logic rejects the validity of the law of excluded. Classical logic and mathematics are unjustified in their assumption every mathematical can be proved or proved false. This bot looks at the theorems of classical logic and tweets whether they are valid intuitionistically or not.
